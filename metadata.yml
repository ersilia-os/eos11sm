Title: Resemblance to a curated list of known antibiotics
Description: A curated list of about 600 known antibiotics from AntibioticDB and
  the Collins lab (MIT) is used as a reference to identify compounds that 
  resemble known antibiotics. The tool can be used, for example, to remove 
  unattractive compounds in virtual screening. The resemblance score is computed
  using a logistic regression taking into account Tanimoto similarity over 
  multiple molecular fingerprints.
